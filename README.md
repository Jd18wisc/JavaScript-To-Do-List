# JavaScript-To-Do-List
This project was completed as part of an internship application. The HTML file in this repository contains the functions needed to create, maintain, and test a to-do list built in JavaScript.

Right now this project only runs using tests and only the test results are displayed by the HTML (per the application requirements). The next version of this project will expand on its current functionalities to allow users to directly interact with their list, add and move items, and see their list as it updates and changes.
